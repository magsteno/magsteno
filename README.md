The repo for anything relating to my Shavian steno ('Magpie Theory') project, or other Shavian related things I may work on.

If you notice any issues, please contact me on Discord (aimai#5170) as this is the surest way to reach me.
Alternatively, you can try Twitter (Whersoever), though I don't check it every day.
